1. 3/4 of the way through v125, change squash from 0.95 => 0.98, change temp cutoff
to move 30 (from 31, because odd number = bias against black)

2. v192 -- learning rate erroneously cut to 0.001.  v207 returned to 0.01.
(v206 trained with 0.001, v207 @0.01)

3. v231 -- moved #readouts to 900 from 800.
